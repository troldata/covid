# Assessing the readiness of the German healthcare system for a pandemic (using the example of the COVID-19 pandemic)

In recent years the reduction in healthcare funding, leading to hospital closures and a reduction in available beds, has took place in Germany. These measures reduce access to healthcare, cause longer waiting times and overwork remaining hospitals.

In this work, a study of Covid indicators is carried out to assess the readiness of hospitals to accomodate sick people during periods of high incidence based on current bed capacities. Information on the number of cases and deaths at the national and federal states levels in the first two years is analyzed. A technique is demonstrated that can be used to roughly estemate the readiness of hospitals to accept COVID-19 patients in the federal states.

Aims of this study:
+ Presentation of country-level data over in the first two years.
+ Assessment of the situation in the federal states and the willingness of hospitals to admit patients during the peak of the incidence.
